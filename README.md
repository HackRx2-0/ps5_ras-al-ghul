# **Krishi Sahayak**

**“Krishi Sahayak”** is an Android mobile app that aims to give farmer easy access to the critical data about their farm with the ease of a mobile app. Pest, Disease, soil temperature and soil moisture data will be detected using sensors and the farmer will be alerted as and when they exceed the standard limit using state of the art IOT technology. With agriculture contributing to almost 15-20% of India’s GDP, sustainable and smart farming will not just help the farmer and his family earn and live better but also significantly move the small scale economy up and eventually the larger impact of “Krishi Sahayak” will change lives, agriculture and economy of our country.

## Technical details
The app is built with flutter and backend is built with node.js.

Currently we are using dummy data generated at backend since getting actual data from IOT devices was not possible in such a short span of time. The voice notification data is sent from backend and handled and translated if necessary in front-end.
